  <p>“Free software” means software that respects users’ freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.</p>

  <p>You may have paid money to get copies of a free program, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies.</p>

<p>Libre software is software that respects the freedom of its users. The <a href="https://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a> calls it “Free Software”.</p>

<p>You may have heard people referring to it as “Open Source Software”. According to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html">“Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software”</a> by <a href="https://stallman.org">Richard Stallman</a> at the GNU project, the term “Open Source” does not explain it correctly. However, he notes that the term “Libre Software” is aligned with “Free Software”, though “Libre” is not plain English.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-better-than-proprietary-software-alternatively-what-is-wrong-with-proprietary-software-that-isnt-true-with-libre-software">Why is better than proprietary software? (Alternatively, what is wrong with proprietary software that isn’t true with libre software?)</h1>
<p>You might think that since nonfree software is so popular, there is a good reason to use it.</p>

<p>In some sense, that is (sadly) true. People use proprietary operating systems like Windows, because they are compatible with the software that came first—proprietary software. This is partly due to the prominence of proprietary software developers rising since the 1980s. The Free Software Movement started later, and we need to catch up.</p>

<p>Most people, which may or may not include you, almost exclusively use proprietary software. Microsoft Windows, macOS, Microsoft Office, etc. You name it. These pieces of software are not libre software—they do not give you any permission to read, edit, or use their code in any way, shape or form. This results in the user—even those with exceptional programming abilities—unable to clearly know what is going on in the program they are using. What if the program is selling their users’ data? What if they are attempting to use that data to manipulate the users’ minds? We have no way of knowing, since even a programmer couldn’t figure it out without access to the source code.</p>

<p>On the other hand, libre software allows anybody to view the source code. With minimum programming knowledge, they could easily know what is going on in the program. They could also add features to it, be it developed by themself or by others who are willing to share their code.</p>

<p>This gives users absolute control over their computing, a.k.a. freedom, along with much more privacy. You don’t have to worry about being manipulated by someone who is willing to sell your information to everyone.</p>
